Save your congratulations and your flowers<br />
My baby is sunbathing on the moon<br />
And with the eternal blue light she glows<br />
In her clear house, with shutters<br />
Save your kind regards, and visits<br />
With doughnuts and kisses<br />
Save your little nothings that amount to nothing<br />
Save it save it<br />
Purple green and christened blue<br />
The flowers dug deep from hell<br />
That you ring round my room<br />
Another woman would have liked them anyway<br />
Save your flowers and your missives<br />
My skin is old and supple<br />
But I am fair maiden only to my tiny vixen<br />
Milking and milking, blue note on blue<br />
Save your sadness and your leads of love<br />
Your love won’t hold me<br />
Like a goddess uncuckcooned<br />
Ill repute, little babe of udders<br />
Stirring the inevitable<br />
Dancing dancing<br />
But not by myself anymore<br />
Wrapping and wrapping the skin on the moon<br />
So save your chrysanthemums and lilacs<br />
Roses and tulips<br />
Save your winter buds, and sun yellow weeds<br />
I won’t need them where I’m going<br />
Brave icelet unbecoming<br />
Praying only backwards<br />
Praying praying on the moon
