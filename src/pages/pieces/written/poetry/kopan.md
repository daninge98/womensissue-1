I once watched a cow give birth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the middle of a highway. Out of her opening<br />
fell an opening, wet and brown and trembling. The cars<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;skirted around her. Some men reached out<br />
from their windows to slap her on the rear.

What is it we agree to when we come in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to this world? We walk up the hill each morning,<br />
barefoot, picking up dirt, dirt we believe has prayers in it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the prayer flags strewn over pines at the top of the mountain<br />
so that the wind will daily scatter them

over the village where they are flattened<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under tour buses, motorbikes, half-constructed<br />
houses where low caste boys hammer out copper plates<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all day, flattened under the water buffalo in the rice paddies,<br />
its black muscles heaped together, its hot mind, its wet hooves.

Do we say yes before entering the day–<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is assumed, it is presumed, that this world<br />
and the things in it will touch you and you will not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be able to wash off that dirt.  

Would they show us the contract… would they have law<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explain it all to us – explain the body. Explain the body.<br />
Explain the body.  Law says all bodies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are in a hierarchy, the brute<br />
force of this world has a certain smile,

it smells like a thick clean-shaven chin. Show me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the land where nothing governs except the sun. Can<br />
not have it – plant, animal, woman, man, law, god –<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explain god. Explain god. Animal<br />
kingdom, biological justification, Darwinian theory,<br />

explain the body, explain the body. Cannot reason<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with flesh. No logic to be found in it. Touch<br />
the wet dark mushroom, you can dismantle it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by simply touching: look, the gills break apart<br />
in your hands. How you dismantle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mind. How you unmake<br />
the voice.

A woman limping asks us what it is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that we are doing. Are we praying? The body inside the god<br />
says yes – no – the god inside the body says yes and I am<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returning as an extension of earth and you must<br />
recover your sensitivity it is a new law, we have not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stopped speaking to you it is you who has ceased <br />
to hear it. Hear it.
