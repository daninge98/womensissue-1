The stones come to dance; parachuting up, four<br />
black rocks gasp slowly for air like fish in a daze.<br />
My feet dart ripples in the water, cool and neat<br />
as knives. Wind aching to peel down my pant-<br />
ies. It sings my skirt off my skin, ripped in fishbone-two.<br />
It wants inside me, the Black Girl Reading by the River.

And I may just be the Black Girl Reading by the River,<br />
but there’s something too-familiar in what the wind runs tor-<br />
ward. The thought churns blood-wild, iron softened into dew.<br />
I tell the wind I’ve seen worse things than dress billowing: a gaze<br />
that killed me. A boy that took, dressed as a man who pant-<br />
ed on my face till it burst. Till. Till. Till. My red tissue was eat-

en white. His lips rolled thick like sausage meat.<br />
Thanks to him my tongue always sags with cotton. Words quiver<br />
in my mouth marred by moths. Many men I’ve met can’t<br />
name themselves. Don’t know you can’t bloom what is broken or<br />
ajar or worse. Look at the stones popping up and out like the craze<br />
of a foal’s kneecaps. Does the river roll for the town it lamplit blue?

The sun, a golden retriever, chases the stick God threw<br />
over the horizon (unlike the wind he didn’t catcall in the street),<br />
the egg-white beast running till the yolk of a thousand Sundays<br />
fills my throat. I think of choking. His erection was like a frozen liver,<br />
hard but of so much flesh. Here my body tips at right-angles to pour<br />
him out downstream. After the breaking I was dust-bodied, a pant-

her cremated. Six-year-old me thought myself participant<br />
to my own Jenga. At least the wind had the manners to chew<br />
me gumless when he salivated me whole. Took his time for<br />
the quenching. Do boys think of rivers, of gasping rocks, of heat?<br />
Lust stark as awaited rain? Black Girl as a thin crumbling, like a sliver<br />
of rust? I prayed wordless for my pupils to pool into hazel.

Now I pray for them to be alive. Then I can sew a dais<br />
brimming with all the Mes who died before Me, a twilit pant-<br />
heon big-boned with the swords of Survivors at the River.<br />
A hill fisted so tight no wind can peel inside; only the many few<br />
who gasped in blackness, pulling oxygen from the mud-sweet.<br />
For once we’d rip loudly from laughter, and nothing more.

Skinned stones jiving in the river wink: Sister, me too,<br />
us too, been blazed the brightest black from this rampant beat-<br />
ing of waves. We always dance when our bodies break against the shore.
