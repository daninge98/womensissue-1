I too am gathering the vulgarity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of botany, the eye and its nuclei for mischief.

Of Man, redacted I came, am coming,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fasting, starving carved

myself a selfish idol, its shell unsuitable. I, twice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discarded, arrived thornside, and soon outgrew

his reptilian sheen. A fine specimen. Let me have it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something inviolate; splayed in bird-lime,

legs an exposed anemone, against jailbait August,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its X-ray sky. This light a Gorgon-slick, polygamous

doom. And God again calling much too late, who<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aches to stick an ache in my unmentionable.

His Primal Plant remains elusive—<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wildfire and pathogen, blood-knot of human

fleshed there in His beard. How I am hot for it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call me murderess, a glowing engine

timed to blow. Watch it go with unjealousy, shadow.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me have it. This maidenhead-primeval

schemes what ovule of cruel invention;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Venus-trap, the menses.

And how many ways to announce this guilt: whore’s nest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of ague, supernova, wild stigmata.

Womb. I boast a vogue sacrosanctum. Engorging<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shored pornographies, the cells’ unruly

strain, rogue empire multiplying for a thousand virile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand years; my wings pinned wide

in parthenogenesis, such miraculous display.
