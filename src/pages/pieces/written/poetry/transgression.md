I know the dead are watching me naked.<br />
It restores me. We spoon and fuck<br />
harder than all their sick-loving widows, widowers.<br />
There’s the relief of nothing being<br />
for pleasure. Nobody drives.<br />
I beg them to congregate around my invisible thoughts<br />
and howl at my original animus<br />
but all they want is a body. It’s fine.<br />
They rope me to this world with nonchalance.<br />
That’s romance. This is the forest<br />
where we are connected in multiple okay ways,<br />
sibling, parent, patient, child. Each of us<br />
is just the inner life of the other.<br />
A furrier version of my voice says come<br />
and means it could never be gross or tiresome<br />
to watch me expel my own disgust.
