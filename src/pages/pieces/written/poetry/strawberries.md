A car’s tires thu-thunk<br />
over the rubbery black trip wire at the oil change,<br />
triggering a fat bell,<br />
and a group of girls in silver leotards are reflected<br />
like spatters of sap in its windows—<br />
liquidine, firm, gleaming.<br />
It’s a Game Day; they are the girls<br />
chosen to split in tempo to the brass band,<br />
heel of a front foot sliding over Astro-Turf,<br />
top of a back foot grinding over lit green,<br />
cervix slapping the fifty-yard line<br />
like a fried egg flipped down on a griddle to burn.<br />
Behind the bleachers, a boy takes off the shirt of another boy,<br />
paints a letter there in red paint (R,<br />
and then another boy I-O-T...).<br />
When the sun goes down over the ridge<br />
all the painted boys will make PATRIOTS.<br />
For now the sun rises, sanctioning the street:<br />
Jiffy Lube, pet store, the Sam’s Super Sandwiches<br />
teens file into, practicing the joke of language—<br />
I love you... I like your faded shirt...<br />
The morning is cool on the outside<br />
and hot in the restaurant, the war in the words<br />
playful as a war can be, meaning<br />
each gut bleeds out like a slit pig’s,<br />
filling the cracks in linoleum, spilling over, becoming smooth.<br />
The layers of red dry and build on one another,<br />
and for years the gap between ceiling and floor lessens;<br />
backs hunch as the mind saws downward, revealing rings.<br />
In the parking lot, Are you asleep?<br />
says the boy who is not my boyfriend,<br />
running his fingers along the band of my underwear.<br />
Across the street from this, for years,<br />
an ancient tortoise roams the floor<br />
of the pet store, closing his army-green beak<br />
around the red toenails of sandaled women,<br />
thinking them strawberries.<br />
I feel ashamed for all the people<br />
I’ve been kind to knowing kindness<br />
is all it will take.
