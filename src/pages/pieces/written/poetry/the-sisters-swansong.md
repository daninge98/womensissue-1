We died one by one,<br />
each plumper than the mirror<br />
saw us. We exited obligingly,<br />
rattling key chains and<br />
cocktail jewelry, rehearsing<br />
our ghostly encores.

Glad to be rid of pincurls<br />
and prayers, bunions<br />
burning between<br />
ironed sheets—we sang<br />
our laments, praised God<br />
and went our way

quietly, were mourned<br />
in satin and chrysanthemums,<br />
whiskey and cake, old gossip<br />
evaporating into cautionary tales.<br />
Does it matter who went<br />
first? Corinna or Fay,

heartache or coronary,<br />
a reckless scalpel or<br />
a careless life—whoever was left<br />
kept count on the dwindling<br />
rosary: Suzanna, Kit.<br />
Mary. Violet. Pearl.

We all died of insignificance.
