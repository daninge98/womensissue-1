“ ”


We have a soft spot for drama,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for memorization;

we like to share whatever we have been told.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We liken ourselves to tadpoles, to works-in-progress,

to fishhooks, to earbuds, to loquacious<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teens, and to their vintage Princess phones.

We used to believe that, being so good<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at belatedness, we might never have to get old,

which was our mission, or our curse;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;though our true age is unclear, we have had equivalents

in nearly every civilization,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both in our efforts at sarcasm and our attempts<br />
at protests. Leave our single sisters alone.

We come in several shapes but are never<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heartless, or pointless, and never entirely straight.

If you ever see just one of us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wait.
