__*When did you start writing poetry?*__

I started writing poetry when I was around 13 years old, so around the time I started high school. <br /><br />

__*Is there anything in particular that inspired you to start writing poetry?*__

I grew up reading a lot of short stories and fiction in general, and it appealed to me because of its concision and because of the power of the form and the fact that it is so more memorable. All of these factors contributed to the passion that I had for writing poetry really led me to keep writing. <br /><br />

__*The poem we will be discussing is, “Alive,” based in Iowa. Are you from Iowa yourself?*__

I am not from Iowa, but I did go there back in 2015, when I was attending the University of Iowa Young Writers’ Studio, and I absolutely loved the city, and it was inspired by experience there.<br /><br />

__*How has the experience in Iowa had a prolonged effect on your life since the poem focuses so much on the location?*__

My time in Iowa definitely shaped me in ways unrelated to the poem because of the Young Writers’ Studio. I learned a lot about craft, and it shaped my vision as a writer. It also allowed me to meet a lot of other young writers there. As for the actual poem itself, it is somewhat unrelated to Iowa; although, the scenery in Iowa did evoke a lot of the images in the poem. <br /><br />

__*In what ways is it unrelated to Iowa?*__

A lot of times when I try to write poems, I try to combine different parts of my life into one poem, so it is not just one concrete retelling of an experience, but rather a meshing of experiences to create or convey more of an emotional idea that may not exactly be concentrated in one time-period but may be across times that all converge on one idea. In that sense, the setting of Iowa is not entirely related to the movement of the poem itself, but the emotional themes converge together. <br /><br />

__*Which parts of your life inspired this poem, besides your time in Iowa?*__

I should mention that this is not true for all of my poems, but for this poem in particular, the events in this poem are not purely autobiographical. If they were, I would have tried to write a non-fiction or autobiographical piece. A lot of the time what I try to do is think of the emotions in my life that have resonated with me very strongly. So in this poem, it is the idea of resilience and the idea of being alive.  I wanted to recreate that in the best way artistically and to transfer that feeling as authentically as possible; therefore, the exact actions of the poem might not be entirely related to my actual life, but the emotions behind them drive the poem. <br /><br />

__*The way that I read this poem was that there was a main character and her mother. So is this a particular moment you are describing between you and your mother, or is it again part of the non-autobiographical aspect?*__

I think the lines between autobiography and fiction can be somewhat blurred. Sometimes it is difficult to differentiate what exactly you yourself have experienced and what you have witnessed through seeing. I think that because this is for The Women’s Issue, this so much about the idea of female strength and female resilience and being in solidarity with women before you, including one’s own mother. <br /><br />

__*Reading the poem, it seems that there is an airy abruptness/trailing off for some of the lines, particularly when you write “wind falling away to.” What inspired this particular style?*__

It came about rather organically when I began writing the poem. I didn’t set out specifically to try to create that effect, but I think that as I was writing it, the idea of the breath being a fist of loose wind led me to physically, on the page, mimicking the falling away of the breath into nothing and portraying that what is left, in the next line, is only that fear. I try to very hard about the enjambments in the poem and the way that the poem reads. I wanted to recreate that sort of physical effect. <br /><br />

__*What does “the glass of us” signify for the dynamics between a person and their mother, since you mentioned the different generations?*__

When I was writing it, the idea that I had in mind was that the glass represented a sort of barrier. Physically it could be the barrier of the face, and more metaphorically, or figuratively, I was thinking of it as a sort of emotional barrier of repression that you have been holding back for a long time and wanting to break through that. Those are the two barriers that I wanted to play with in the “glass of us” to show to people having the same experience simultaneously, even though the wording would be less awkward if it were the “glass of each of us.” It is meant to capture the solidarity between the breaking of both barriers at the same time. <br /><br />

__*Why do you choose to use ampersands instead of the word “and”? Does the use signify abruptness or is meant to do something else?*__

That’s funny because usually in my poems I use the word “and” instead of ampersands, but in this case, especially with the line “a lacy grasshopper waxes by our ear &,” I thought that the symbol of the “and” felt so much more compact and minute, and I feel that in relation to the phrase, I wanted to have a continuation of the phrase that didn’t chop up the small image of the lacy grasshopper. The goal is to minimize the intrusion. The ampersand also physically looks like an anchoring point, which I also wanted to convey in terms of an emotional anchoring. <br /><br />

__*When you mention minimizing intrusion, do you mean intrusion on this area, this experience?*__

There is a break between the lacy grasshopper waxing by one’s ear and then the breakage, so I wanted that fulcrum, hinge, or balancing point to be as delicate as possible to make the ultimate breakage fall a little bit more heavily.
This poem is very vivid and dynamic, with the numerous colors and movements mentioned throughout. Why was it important for you to create such a visual poem?
My goal for this poem was to capture the feeling of being alive, and what that’s like to have experienced a lot and finally break through it. There is something very triumphant in that breakage and reclaiming about it, and that is something that is a very physical and emotional process, so I wanted to be able, as best as possible, to push through this barrier of words on the page and have the reader experience a similar emotion and transfer that bodily sense of what is like to be alive.  <br /><br />

__*Though this poem at a first reading seems calm, there is a certain violence to it, with the bird breaking through the glass, and the yellow flames. What motivations are behind this, and why did you choose to depict it in this way?*__

It’s funny you mention violence because it is not the first word that I was thinking of when I was writing the poem when I was writing the poem. I was more so thinking of surrealism of the poem, which I guess can be construed as violent. I think I wanted to imbue the poem with that physical sense and the process of feeling so suddenly alive in yourself after maybe a period of feeling more melancholy, so I really wanted to capture that sense of finally breaking through into yourself and being able to feel all of your feelings. The representation of glass was the best way for me to incorporate that action of breaking through, so that is where a lot of the images come through. Once the glass breaks, the whole world seems more alive, so the “corn heads unfurl in yellow flames,” so it feels you are more alive and you see the world around as more alive and more filled with action.
