White Sands, New Mexico. June 7th 2018.

Subject:Manifest:Destituteâ€™ is a reflection of my social reality and it is a piece of fiction, insofar as the body is a fiction. This is an American drama in four acts. Like other American adventures out West, it is violent, one-sided, infused with gendered meaning and symbols, and indebted to nature. This is the story of someone lost in their body who tried to find answers in stolen lands.
